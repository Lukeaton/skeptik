# Lumière

Lumière is an alternative to sites like Medium and the majoity of legacy news outlets.
A place that contributers can publish thoughtful, enlightening articles based on fact,
reason and science. Not emotions and feelings.

Without the pressure of a deadlines, overbearing editors and shareholders influening
the content. Contibutors can publish without the fear of job loss due to social media 
outrage.
Hopefully the reader benefits from this with fully fleshed out articles that can shine
a light in this too often dark world.

Enjoy.
